# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Resend Testing Limitation

## 🔴 The Error You're Seeing:

```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (contact@encodelife.in)
```

---

## 🎯 What This Means:

Resend's **free tier in testing mode** only allows sending emails to **the exact email address you used to sign up**.

The error shows: `contact@encodelife.in` - This is the email you used to create your Resend account.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: Use Your Resend Account Email (Quick Fix)

### Update `.env.local`:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_BBRA8gBg_Kh99Ms1UGrNQDr6jDhsvf96a
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in
```

**Change `heyadrsh@gmail.com` to `contact@encodelife.in`**

Then:
1. Save the file
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Test the form
4. Check `contact@encodelife.in` inbox

✅ **This will work immediately!**

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION 2: Verify Your Domain (Production Ready)

To send emails to **any address** (including `heyadrsh@gmail.com`):

### Step 1: Add Domain to Resend
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `encodelife.in`

### Step 2: Add DNS Records
Resend will show you DNS records to add. Go to your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.) and add:

```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: [Resend provides this]

Type: MX  
Name: @
Value: [Resend provides this]

Type: TXT (DKIM)
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Resend provides this]
```

### Step 3: Wait for Verification
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes
- Check status in Resend dashboard

### Step 4: Update API Route
In `app/api/send-email/route.ts`, change:
```typescript
from: 'Encode Life Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>',
```
To:
```typescript
from: 'Encode Life Contact <contact@encodelife.in>',
```

### Step 5: Now Send to Anyone!
```env
CONTACT_EMAIL=heyadrsh@gmail.com  # ✅ Now this works!
```

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide:

### For Testing Right Now:
- Use `CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in`
- Emails arrive at your Resend account email
- Works immediately

### For Production:
- Verify domain `encodelife.in`
- Use any email: `heyadrsh@gmail.com`
- Takes 10 minutes to set up

---

## 📝 Current Status:

Your `.env.local` currently has:
```env
CONTACT_EMAIL=heyadrsh@gmail.com  ❌ Won't work (not your Resend email)
```

Should be:
```env
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in  ✅ Will work (your Resend email)
```

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix Right Now:

1. Open `.env.local`
2. Change line 6 to: `CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in`
3. Save file
4. Restart: `npm run dev`
5. Test form
6. Check `contact@encodelife.in` inbox

**That's it! It will work!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Why This Happens:

Resend prevents spam by requiring domain verification before sending to external emails. This is standard for all email services (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.).
