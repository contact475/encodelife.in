# Final Navigation Structure ✅

## Header Navigation (Simplified)

Cleaned up the header to show only essential navigation items:

### Current Menu Items:
1. **About Us** → `#about` - Scrolls to About Us section
2. **Blog** → `/blog` - Opens blog listing page
3. **Contact** → `#contact-section` - Scrolls to contact form

### Removed from Header:
- PLA
- Applications
- Circularity
- Media

**Reason**: Simplified navigation for better user experience. Users can explore these sections by scrolling through the page naturally.

## Footer Navigation (Simplified)

Restructured footer into 2 clean columns:

### Column 1: Quick Links
- **About Us** → `/#about`
- **Blog** → `/blog`
- **Contact** → `/#contact-section`

### Column 2: Get in Touch
- **+91 84487 13902** → `tel:+918448713902`
- **+91 70000 17005** → `tel:+917000017005`
- **contact@encodelife.in** → `mailto:contact@encodelife.in`

### Removed from Footer:
- Product section (PLA Bioplastics, Applications, Circularity)
- Resources section (redundant links)
- Company section (merged into Get in Touch)

**Reason**: Cleaner, more focused footer with essential contact information prominently displayed.

## About Us Section Fix

Added `id="about"` to the About Us section in `feature-section-with-hover-effects.tsx`:

```tsx
<section id="about" className="py-20 lg:py-32 px-6 lg:px-12 bg-background">
```

Now the "About Us" link in both header and footer correctly scrolls to this section.
