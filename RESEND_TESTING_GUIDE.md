# 🔧 Resend Testing Mode - Important!

## ⚠️ Current Limitation

You're seeing this error:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (contact@encodelife.in)
```

This is **normal** for Resend's free tier in testing mode!

---

## 🎯 Quick Fix (Testing Mode)

### Your `.env.local` should have:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in
```

**IMPORTANT:** `CONTACT_EMAIL` must be the **same email** you used to sign up for Resend!

---

## ✅ How to Test Right Now:

1. Make sure `CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in` in `.env.local`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Fill out contact form
4. Check `contact@encodelife.in` inbox
5. ✅ Email should arrive!

---

## 🚀 For Production (Send to Any Email):

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)

1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain: `encodelife.in`
4. Add these DNS records to your domain provider:

```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: [Resend will provide]

Type: MX
Name: @
Value: [Resend will provide]

Type: TXT (DKIM)
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Resend will provide]
```

5. Wait 5-10 minutes for verification
6. Update API route:

```typescript
// In app/api/send-email/route.ts
from: 'Encode Life Contact <contact@encodelife.in>',
```

7. Now you can send to ANY email address!

### Option 2: Use Different Service

If you don't want to verify a domain, alternatives:

**SendGrid:**
- Free tier: 100 emails/day
- No domain verification needed
- More complex setup

**EmailJS:**
- Free tier: 200 emails/month
- No domain verification needed
- Client-side only

**Nodemailer + Gmail:**
- Free
- Uses your Gmail account
- Requires app password

## 🎯 Current Status:

✅ **Working:** Sending to `contact@encodelife.in`
❌ **Not Working:** Sending to other emails (until domain verified)

## 📝 Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Resend API key added to `.env.local`
- [ ] `CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@encodelife.in` in `.env.local`
- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Form submitted
- [ ] Check `contact@encodelife.in` inbox (including spam)

---

## 🔍 Verify Your Setup:

1. Check `.env.local`:
```bash
# Should show your API key and email
cat .env.local
```

2. Check Resend Dashboard:
   - Go to [Resend Emails](https://resend.com/emails)
   - See delivery logs
   - Check for errors

---

## 💡 Pro Tip:

For now, just use `contact@encodelife.in` as the recipient. Once you verify your domain, you can send to anyone!

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Check API Key:**
   - Go to [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
   - Make sure key is active
   - Copy it again if needed

2. **Check Email:**
   - Must be `contact@encodelife.in`
   - Check spam folder
   - Check Resend dashboard logs

3. **Restart Server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📊 What's Happening:

```
User submits form
    ↓
API receives data
    ↓
Resend checks: "Is recipient = your account email?"
    ↓
YES → ✅ Email sent
NO  → ❌ Error 403 (domain not verified)
```

**For testing: Use `contact@encodelife.in` as recipient!**
**For production: Verify your domain at resend.com/domains**
