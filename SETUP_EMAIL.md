# Email Setup Guide for Encode Life Contact Form

## Overview
The contact form uses **Resend** to send emails directly without a backend or database. When users submit the form, it triggers a Next.js API route that sends a formatted email to your inbox.

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free tier)
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your API Key
1. Go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Encode Life Production")
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### Local Development:
1. Open `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Add your credentials:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

#### Vercel Deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add two variables:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = your Resend API key
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL` = email where you want to receive submissions
4. Make sure to add them for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments

### 4. Domain Setup (Optional but Recommended)

By default, Resend uses `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender. For production:

1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `encodelife.com`)
4. Add the DNS records shown to your domain provider
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)
6. Update the API route:

```typescript
// In app/api/send-email/route.ts, change:
from: 'Encode Life Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>',
// To:
from: 'Encode Life Contact <contact@yourdomain.com>',
```

```
1. Navigate to the contact section
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Send message"
4. Check your email inbox

### Production Testing:
After deploying to Vercel, test the live form to ensure emails are being sent.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send email" error:
