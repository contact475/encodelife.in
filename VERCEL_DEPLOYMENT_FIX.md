# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
Your Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Type error: Cannot find module 'mdx/types' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

The issue has been **FIXED**. Here's what was done:

### 1. Fixed MDX Types Error
- Removed dependency on `fumadocs-mdx` and `fumadocs-ui` packages (not installed)
- Simplified `mdx-components.tsx` to work without external dependencies
- Your blog system uses hardcoded content, so MDX parsing isn't needed

### 2. Optimized Build Script
- Removed `--turbopack` flag from build command
- This prevents build hanging issues

### 3. Cleaned Up Code
- Removed unused imports and components that were causing warnings

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel Now

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   cd encode-life
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve MDX types error and optimize build"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically deploy** the new commit

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Vercel CLI
```bash
cd encode-life
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to: **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key for email functionality
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL` - Email address to receive contact form submissions

## 🧪 Test Locally First (Optional)

Before deploying, you can test the build locally:

```bash
cd encode-life

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# If build succeeds, test it
npm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify everything works.

## 📋 What Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `mdx-components.tsx` | Simplified to remove fumadocs dependency |
| `source.config.ts` | Commented out unused fumadocs config |
| `package.json` | Removed `--turbopack` from build script |
| `feature-section-with-hover-effects.tsx` | Removed unused code |

## ✅ Expected Result

Your Vercel build should now:
- ✅ Complete successfully
- ✅ Pass TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Deploy without errors
- ⚠️ Show some ESLint warnings (these are non-critical)

## 🔍 Verifying the Fix

After deployment, check:
1. **Build logs** - Should show "Build completed successfully"
2. **Website** - Should load at your Vercel URL
3. **All pages** - Home, About, Blog, Contact should work
4. **Contact form** - Should send emails (if env vars are set)

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Vercel build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify Node.js version** - Should be 18.x or higher
3. **Clear Vercel cache:**
   - Go to Project Settings → General
   - Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
   - Click "Clear Cache"
   - Redeploy

4. **Check environment variables** are set correctly

## 📝 Notes

- The blog currently uses hardcoded content from `lib/blog.ts`
- MDX files in `blog/content/` exist but aren't being parsed
- If you want to use MDX files in the future, you'll need to install `fumadocs-mdx` and `fumadocs-ui`
- ESLint warnings about `<img>` tags are cosmetic and won't block deployment

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ Vercel build completes without errors
- ✅ Your site is live and accessible
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ No 404 or 500 errors

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Vercel build logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Try clearing Vercel cache and redeploying
4. Check that your Git repository is up to date
